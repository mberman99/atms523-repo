# This is the main repository for ATMS 523 Module 8 Assignment

This repository contains the code and results for ATMS 523 final assignment. 

For my project, I developed a machine learning workflow to predict tropopause heights from various characteristics from observed soundings from the RELAMPAGO field campaign in 2018-19 (Nesbitt et al. 2021). The observed sounding data can be found here: https://doi.org/10.26023/EXZJ-XBEV-KV05. 

I intercompared three different regression models from SKLearn and then took the best performing one and used randomized grid searching to improve it further.
